# Sentimental-Analysis-with-bag-of-words-and-naive-bayesian-with-R-language
I compared the performance of bag of words techniques with Naive bayesian.
For the bag of words technique we dont need any algorithm or training data, we did the analysis with brute force by counting the number of positive and negative words in the give feedback. If positive words are more then negative words then we classify it as positive fedback else it is negaative feedback.
I refered a lexicon from oxford dictionary to findout which are positive and negative words.
Used a dataset of 2000 movie reviews which contains 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews.
trained the naive bayesian with 1500 randomly choosen reviews.
